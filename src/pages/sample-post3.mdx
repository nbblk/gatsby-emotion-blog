# Transition

The Transition component lets you describe a transition from one component state to another over time with a simple declarative API. Most commonly it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also be used to describe in-place transition states as well.

Note: Transition is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use CSSTransition instead. It inherits all the features of Transition, but contains additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the name of the component).

By default the Transition component does not alter the behavior of the component it renders, it only tracks "enter" and "exit" states for the components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:
